    Mike Naig proudly serves as Iowa's Secretary of Agriculture.
</p>

<p>
    Early in his life, Mike learned the value of hard work from his dad and uncle on 
    their crop and livestock farm near Cylinder, Iowa. Mike has spent his entire career working 
    in agriculture and is inspired by the passion and commitment of the hard working men and 
    women who keep us fed and fueled. As the fourth generation from his family's farm, Mike understands 
    rural Iowa and the importance of caring for the land while ensuring that Iowa farms 
    provide a great living for farmers.
</p>

<p>
    Mike joined the <a href="https://iowaagriculture.gov/" target="_blank">Iowa Department of Agriculture &amp; Land Stewardship</a> 
    in 2013 as Deputy Secretary to former Secretary Bill Northey. As Deputy, Mike was responsible for overseeing the operations 
    of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship through development of policy and responsibility for budget 
    and personnel. One of his involvements at the Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship has included working 
    towards developing an intensive plan that utilizes research and lays out steps that improve water quality and soil 
    health. As the Deputy, Mike has lead multiple trade missions around the world, advocating for Iowa agriculture, 
    both domestically and internationally. He knows the importance of building strong relationships and works with 
    industry leaders to strengthen trade agreements and all markets that positively impact farmers.
</p>

<p>
    Mike was appointed to the position of Secretary by Governor Kim Reynolds on March 5, 2018 when his predecessor, 
    Bill Northey, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve as USDA Undersecretary. He was elected to a full 
    term on Nov. 6, 2018.
</p>

<p>
    Mike is a graduate of <a href="https://www.bvu.edu/" target="_blank">Buena Vista University</a> in 
    Storm Lake with degrees in biology and political science. Mike and his wife Jaime have three 
    boys: Mitch, Zach, and Joe. They are both active members of the Zion Lutheran Church and are active 
    within their community. Mike and Jaime spend as much time as possible on the Naig family century 
    farm in Northwest Iowa, teaching their boys the lessons and values that come with being 
    involved on a generational Iowa farm.

    Dr. Kelly Thorpe's research focuses on the development and application of informational technologies to 
    understand cropping system processes, improve management of water and nutrients for crop production, 
    and enhance plant breeding and genetics research.  A key emphasis is the collection and processing 
    of radiometric data and remote sensing images to map crop and soil spatial variation, including new 
    efforts using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and applications of hyperspectral remote sensing in the 
    visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared wavebands. Dr. Thorpe also develops, evaluates, and applies  
    cropping system simulation models, including the Cropping System Model (CSM) as distributed with the 
    Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) and others. Efforts are currently focused 
    on the development of modeling methodologies that integrate remote sensing and soil moisture data 
    for improved cotton irrigation management. Other interest areas include crop water and nitrogen 
    status assessment, precision agriculture, management of nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation and 
    drainage water management, field-based plant phenomics, and development of new bioenergy crops.
